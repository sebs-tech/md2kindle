ChatGPT follows a Markdown rendering style that is similar to **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)**, with a few modifications to enhance the user experience within this chat interface. Here's an overview of how Markdown works in ChatGPT:

### Supported Markdown Features:
1. **Headings**:
   ```markdown
   # Heading 1
   ## Heading 2
   ### Heading 3
   ```

2. **Bold and Italic**:
   ```markdown
   **Bold text**
   *Italic text*
   ```

3. **Lists**:
   - **Unordered Lists**:
     ```markdown
     - Item 1
     - Item 2
     ```

   - **Ordered Lists**:
     ```markdown
     1. Item 1
     2. Item 2
     ```

4. **Links**:
   ```markdown
   [OpenAI](https://openai.com)
   ```

5. **Images** (not rendered in this chat interface):
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](image-url.jpg)
   ```

6. **Code Blocks**:
   - **Inline code**: `` `code` ``
   - **Block code**:
     ```markdown
     ```python
     print("Hello, world!")
     ```
     ```

7. **Blockquotes**:
   ```markdown
   > This is a quote
   ```

8. **Tables**:
   ```markdown
   | Header 1 | Header 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | Row 1    | Row 1    |
   | Row 2    | Row 2    |
   ```

9. **Horizontal Rules**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   ```

### Limitations:
- **Images** are supported in Markdown syntax but are not rendered within the ChatGPT interface.
- **HTML** tags (e.g., `<div>`, `<span>`) will not be rendered, though some basic HTML tags might work.
- Some more advanced GFM features like task lists (e.g., `[ ]` or `[x]`) and emojis are not rendered as they are in other GFM implementations.

### Custom Behavior in ChatGPT:
- The platform is optimized to handle user-generated content, so certain elements are enhanced for readability, and code blocks are formatted well for multi-language syntax highlighting.
- ChatGPT doesnâ€™t enforce strict GFM rules but follows similar conventions, and the output is adjusted for conversation flow.

So, while there isn't a specific **ChatGPT Markdown flavor**, it is closely aligned with GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) with some tailored features for this environment.
